### Motivation

While R has no _native_ support for 64-bit integer values, the [`bit64`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bit64) by Jens Oehlschl√§gel is widely used to fill this
gap by (very carefully) passing the bitmaps of `int64_t` values around in `double`.  This works on
the R side by virtue of a S3 class `integer64` with proper dispatching, and on the C/C++ side where
the values can be past by `memcpy`.  What one cannot do is simply copying or casting: the tradeoff
made in representing a `double` with as large a range is that the 'delta' between values is not
constant acros the range and naive casting between both representation *will* be lossy and distort
values.

This package contains helper functions that were previously appearing in helper header files in
different packages, and reorganizes them along with a proper unit tests.  The key header file
provided here can be included directly. Function to assert `integer64` source, convert to and from
in both scalar and vector cases as well as a pair of `as<>()` and `wrap()` converters are provided.

As our [nanotime package](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/nanotime) builds on the same `integer64`
infrastructure, its bi-directional conversions between R and C++ are also supported.

## Examples

### Int64

The example for the included demonstration function show how a vector of
`integer64` values (here spanning the power of 10 ranging from 0 to 18)
can be received in C++, altered (where we just add one) and returned, all
while maintaining `integer64` aka `int64_t` type.

```r
> example(Int64toInt64)

I64I64> # generate all powers of 10 fro 0 .. 18
I64I64> v <- bit64::as.integer64(10^seq(0,18))

I64I64> # pass them to function which will add one to each, print  and return
I64I64> Int64toInt64(v)

### Nanotime

Similarly, we can instantiate a vector of `nanotime` values and increment, show, and return its
values.

```r
> example(NanotimeToNanotime)

NntmTN> # generate all powers of 10 fro 0 .. 18
NntmTN> if (requireNamespace("nanotime", quietly=TRUE)) {
NntmTN+     v <- nanotime::as.nanotime(10^seq(0,18))
NntmTN+     # pass them to function which will add one to each, print  and return
NntmTN+     NanotimeToNanotime(v)
NntmTN+ }
