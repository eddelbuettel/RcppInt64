Description: 'Int64' values can be created and accessed via the 'bit64' package and its 'integer64'
 class which package the 'int64' representation cleverly into a 'double'. The 'nanotime' packages
 builds on this to support nanosecond-resolution timestamps. This packages helps conversions between
 'R' and 'C++' via several helper functions provided via a single header file.  A complete example
 client package is included as an illustration.
