Description: 'Int64' values can be created and accessed via the 'bit64' package and its 'integer64'
 class which package the 'int64' representation cleverly into a 'double'. This packages helps
 conversions between 'R' and 'C++' via several helper functions provided via a single header file.
 A complete example client package is included as an illustration.
